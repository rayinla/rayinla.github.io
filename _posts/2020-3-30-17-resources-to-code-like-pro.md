Whatever language you decide to learn will have its own set of quirks that you have to grapple with. Sometimes, you may feel like you’re not quite cut out for programming. But don’t fear. Anyone can learn to program with a little bit of perseverance. Results won’t occur in a month, two months, or three months. It may take a year or more to make much progress.

However long it takes, there will come a point where your skills will be sharpened enough to work in teams of coders to build and maintain projects.
