Failing Taught Me How to Code
===========

My arm pits were sweating as time ticked away. I needed to get my tests to pass by completing the long list of objectives that I’d started since 9 in the morning. Time was running out: the test was supposed to be over at 7 p.m.,and there was five minutes left till then. I wasn’t going to finish in time, I knew. Took me too long to properly set up class structures. Damn. Didn’t know the test was going to be this difficult. Hardly anytime for Google searches. Fires needed to be put out. The problems were becoming progressively more difficult. 

7 p.m. The test was over. I hung my head, dejected. There was a glimmer of hope that I’d passed the assessment test that would allow me to move onto the next round in the coding bootcamp; I’d gotten a lot of tests to pass.  I plopped on my ergo chair, chatting it up with my cohort, trying to be optimistic about my prospects. We would get our results emailed to us later in the night.

<h3>I found my result after commuting home.</h3> 

I failed. My heart sank. I screamed into a pillow. 

But then I settled down. My bootcamp allowed you to repeat a segment just one more time. Bootcamps don’t like failures. This one was one of the more lenient ones. Know what I did next?

I looked at all the lesson briefings I’d skimmed over, too tired to read them after spending the whole day working on coding problems with a partner(pair groupings are taxing). I realized that I’d skimmed over a lot of crucial information, information that would have allowed me to solve problems a lot more quicker.  

I also broke down my learning pattern at the camp. I realized that I spent far too much time paying attention to others rather than focusing on my work. I did a lot of complaining about the difficulty of coding with my cohort mates. I did a lot of sitting. 

To fix these problems, I got some headphones to drown out noise and made sure to fully take advantage of my time alone. Rather than lazily skating through practise problems, I attacked them as if a paycheck was dangling over my face. My new cohort mates, the fresh recruits, thought I was a man possessed. 

I even surprised myself. I began solving problems that I thought I was “too dumb to solve.” A particular favorite of mine was the snake search algorithm. I kept pushing and pushing to the point that my mentor just looked at me and said during a code review, “Wow, Raji, I’m impressed. This is great.”

By the time the exam rolled in, I popped in my headphones and listened to the Weeknd as I cruised through the exam. Throughout my remaining time, I never failed another exam.

<h3>But why? Why the quick turn around?</h3>

This has to do with how we learn. There’s this oft repeated phrase that goes, “practise makes perfect.” Said without context, that is not true--at least not absolutely true. Practice brings the conscience into the subconscious, which is good.


<h3> But bad practice brings bad habits into the subconscious as well. </h3>

An example of one of my bad habits was my overreliance on inefficient methods of problem-solving. Rather than using built in methods, I practised reinventing the machine, fooling myself into believing that I was becoming a good coder. I did this because it was comfortable to draw out code exactly as my brain processed them rather than looking for abstractions. So I became good at being inefficient rather than becoming good at being efficient. 

So, to actually learn something, we have to know the right way to do it. And to know the right way to do things we have to ask questions. I asked a lot more questions my second time round. I made sure that what I was doing was efficient, not only correct. It’s very easy to say, “well, the code works, so that’s that.” But why does it work? How can I do the same thing with less code? Is there some method in the docs that will allow me to achieve this goal?

The next point to note is that I reinforced my learning with review. After spending the day coding, I would get home and go over the lesson plans to ensure that I grasped nuances that would help me improve. We can always reinforce our learning by changing things up. Why not read a book? Then, switch over to a quick and dirty article? What was left out? What can you add? That makes the actual coding more fun because you’re engaged with the code. Now, this is not possible for most people, but, in small increments, it may help some.

Another thing I practised was consistency. It was easy for me to be consistent because I was motivated to pass the exam and I dedicated a fixed number of hours per day to all-in programming. But consistency can be a few minutes per day. How do valleys form? Water erodes rock gradually over time. That’s the indelible mark we want knowledge to leave in our mind. That only happens with constant application.

Next, and most importantly, I wasn’t afraid to take myself out of my comfort zone. I think this is the biggest thing that holds us back from learning. We don’t think we’re ever ready to build something because we’re afraid to fail. Let me just learn this one thing. Wouldn’t it be so cool to know all these languages? I talked with a lawyer who said he’d taken classes to learn C++, TCP/IP, JavaScript, etc. I got around to asking him, “So, did you ever build anything?” He said, “No, I’m still taking classes.”

He was stuck in that vicious cycle that I knew all too well, a cycle that led me to plunge into an overly expensive bootcamp. He was comfortable in that giddy stage of acquiring new information. Once that high is gone, it’s onto the next language. That’s because looking up at that mountain is far too intimidating. Building with the tools you’ve acquired takes resolve.

When you code with the aim to build something you’ve never built before, you’re no longer being passive. You will experience nagging doubt. Frustration. Oh, the frustration. You will learn along the way, but the learning will come through embarrassing mistakes. We do not like to look foolish, even in forums. 

I think the greatest fear is the fear of reaching a dead end if we do take on a project. That’s because by the end you start to think if you’re really cut out for this coding business. And that really hurts. We don’t want to look in the mirror and have to admit that. So, we go back to square one. Rinse and repeat.

How do we get over this hump? Well, a mentor would be a great help. But not all of us has a coding prodigy waiting in the wings. So, the next thing we have to do is ask ourselves what we want to do with coding. I really wanted to learn to code because I always saw myself building a website to connect with others. Others might really want to someday become a senior dev. 

Lay out a step by step plan and envision what you’d need to be able to show off. For me, I needed to be able to become really competent with CSS and have a good understanding of event-based programming, along with some backend knowledge. If you want that job, you  can ask in forums what you need to know. 

Then, you create a portfolio of projects you have to create...why am I mentioning all of this? We have to trick our brains into thinking the goal that we seek is a reality as sure as getting that meal you ordered from GrubHub.

 So, when you encounter a problem that takes more than a day to solve, you’ll keep plugging away because the goal must be reached. When that problem is finally solved, the relief you’d feel will carry you on because you’ve already laid out a plan. Every broken hurdle creates momentum. 

Now, once you do break the hurdle, it’s important to learn from the struggle by recording it. You can have a file for this purpose until you get good at solving that issue. In the Art of Learning, Josh Waitzkin asserts,“If a student of any disciple could avoid ever repeating the same mistake twice, they would skyrocket to the top of their field.” That’s not to say that we can’t make the same mistake twice, it just means we have to be able to self assess.

 My self-assessment allowed me to shed my bad habits quickly. Mere repetition may have allowed me to improve, but it wouldn’t have made a substantial difference. My poor habits would have caught up to me down the line. Rather, my willingness to correct my mistakes vaulted me to nearly the top of the cohort, leading me to earn some appellations, one of them being The CSS Master(relatively-speaking).

I’ll end this long diatribe by saying this: we should at least learn to love what we learn. If you love someone, you’ll be willing to overlook their faults. The same applies to coding. Sitting for long hours is tough. Staring at a screen that hardly changes is tough. Staring at a problem is tough. 

But, hell, the result sure is sweet.
