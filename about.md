Hello, I'm Raji Ayinla--former technical content writer at a web development company. I'm a hobbyist coder and serial writer. I designed this website and wrote these articles to teach others how to code this mystical language called JavaScript. When I was first learning to code, I was frustrated by the lack of practical articles. The articles that did go in depth usually were too advanced, and the ones that took their time felt shallow. I always wanted to have everything I needed on one website. I wanted articles that were well explained, ones that used good analogies to allow me to visualize the concepts. 

I believe this website would've helped "past" me. As a Dev Bootcamp graduate who has a degree in English Literature, I believe that I can communicate tough ideas in a way that everyone can understand--be they novice or experienced. Feel free to ask for help, because your voice will only improve this website as it continues to grow. Thanks for reading.

Happy coding,

Raji Ayinla.
